# dualshock2usb

dualshock2usb is a project that will enable the use of DualShock 2 controllers on windows via an Arduino and XInput.

### Features

-Analogue triggers. (the DualShock 2 has analog buttons)

~~-Wireless controller ?~~

-Full big/small motor rumble support thanks to the ArduinoXInput library.

-Possibly a custom adapter, which will be much sleeker and compact than a bare arduino and jumper wires.

-Based on the XInput API, ensuring compatability with many systems and games.

## Dependencies

This project uses the [Arduino-PS2X](https://github.com/madsci1016/Arduino-PS2X) and [ArduinoXInput](https://github.com/dmadison/ArduinoXInput) Libraries.
